# SmartVacuum
Complete project building a CNN neural network - Aima Python - Pygame

Implementation of a neural network for the recognition of letters from an image. Letters can be both handwritten and artificial. The recognition serves to identify the map in which the smart vacuum will operate, whose task will be to solve the problem by cleaning up all the rooms and positioning itself in the final box. The input image is a handwritten or digital square matrix. For the complete explanation of the project, consult the attached pdf report, which explains everything:
- construction of the convolutional neural network for the recognition of writing
- image analysis
- mapping of the input to the problem to be solved using the structure provided by AIMA python (actions, search, domain problems etc ...)
- problem solving with informed search (A star) and uninformed search (bfs) algorithms
- graphic simulator developed in pygame

At the end of the report there is also a guide for reproducing the project. 
Attached are also all the images for the pygame sprites, images for the matrix test, the already trained cnn model and other images (see guide to understand how to use them).

For any problems with execution or for any improvement, please contact me.
